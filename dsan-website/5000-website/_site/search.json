    "text": "International economics and geopolitics have always piqued my interest as an economics student. “Silk Roads” by Franklin Frankopan is one of the most intriguing books I’ve ever read. According to researchers K. Laug and S. Rance [1], the Silk Road’s establishment prompted countries to pursue comparable interests as a result of European countries’ lack of collaboration. According to them, the rise of Fascism matched a shift in the economic balance of power. Frankopan rightly sees the constraints of liberal democracy in Western countries’ shifting economic and political institutions.\nThis prompted me to investigate and reflect on the intricate processes of geopolitics and the power struggles of the hegemonic states. Hegemonic nations are those having the most powerful military, the greatest superpower, and a developed economy. Nonetheless, developing nations have always posed a danger to global superpowers due to their rapid expansion, higher exports, and improved overall quality of life. For example, India was not what it was 15 years ago. Frankopan’s declaration is an astute and comprehensive assessment of global power dynamics and economics that is glaringly lacking in mainstream Western discourses and media landscapes.\nThe term BRICS was first coined by a Goldman Chief Economist named Jim O’Neill in a research paper that underlined the growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China [2]. The bloc was founded as an informal club in 2009 to challenge the hegemonic domination of the US and it’s western allies. The leaders of the governments and states of the member countries meet once a year, with each country having a one-year alternating presidency of the group.\nThis got me interested to understand the cross-country comparison of BRICS in terms it’s fiscal and macroeconomic policies. According to [3], one of the important factors to boost the economcs is consistent international trade, especially considering China as a manufacturing nation i.e with a comparitive advantage industrially. Another interesting assumption that O’Neil [4] argues about is the growth potential ofthe BRICS countries and how it can only be unleashed if certain macroeconomic policies are adopted in a well-coordinated manner that will promote economic growth and development. But one of the other relevant literature highlights on the importance that due to different cultural, financial and political backgrounds, few BRICS nations gain a comparitive advantage whilst few again an absolute disadvantage. However, it is interesting for me to look into few questions and initially explore so that down the line, an actual exploration can be done to answer an interesting question."
