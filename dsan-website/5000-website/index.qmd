I hope you're having a great day today! I'm Moghal Sheeba, a 23-year old woman from Hyderabad, India. I love animals, beaches and hiking. I'm currently a full-time Master's student from Georgetown University's Masters in Data Science and Analytics.

As a graduate in Economics, I loved the questions that data made me ask the efficent methods I learnt in my undergradate classes, especially the Python class. Economics, especially International Economics made me appreciate data science and it's ability to understand humans and the science of harnessing data driven insights. I wish to find myself working in that bracket one day!
