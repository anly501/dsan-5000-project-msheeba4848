    <h1> Data Gathering </h1>
    Since my problem statement focuses upon the impact of fiscal policy on macroeconomic variables, the data naturally consists of numerical or quantitative data based on time. For this topic, the most reliable websites for data collection were either to physically search for the data or through the usage of APIs (Application Programming Interface). 
    <h2> Data Source </h2>
    Since one of the questions mainly attempts to compare the impacts of fiscal policies between Bangladesh which is an underdeveloped economic and India which is a developing economy, India's data was retrieved from FRED API. The FRED® API is a web service that allows developers to create programmes and construct apps that retrieve statistical information about the economy from the FRED® and ALFRED® websites hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Economic Research Division using Python <cite><a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/">(FRED API, n.d)</a></cite>. <br>
    <br>
    On the other hand, the data for Bangladesh has been retrived from 'wbstats' API which is an R-based interface, that is used for searching and downloading data from World Bank <cite><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wbstats/vignettes/wbstats.html#:~:text=wbstats%3A%20An%20R%20package%20for,from%20the%20World%20Bank%20API.">(wbstats, n.d)</a></cite>.
    <h2> Data Description </h2>

    The data has been collected from 2000-2023.
