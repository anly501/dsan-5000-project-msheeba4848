Since the entire nature of the data is focused on purely data that is quantitative in nature as we are attempting to understand the macro-economic nature of the BRICS, we need data that is retreived from a data bank consisting of a lot of columns. For this topic, the most reliable websites for data collection were either to physically search for the data or through the usage of APIs (Application Programming Interface).

## Data Source

For this project, the data is that is majorly required is numerical data. I am retrieving data through API's and by downloading data from World Bank.

### Quantitative Data

The data required for this project is a culmunation of macroeconomic and fiscal indicators of all the five emerging economics for which individual data has to be retrived using various sources.

##### Python API 

The Python API used for this project is the FRED API. The FRED-API is a web service that allows developers to create programmes and construct apps that retrieve statistical information about the economy from the FRED and ALFRED websites hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis' Economic Research Division using Python. 

Since we are using data of the 5 countries, it can be interesting to compare it with a hegemonic and the most powerful country in the world, The United States of America so using the FRED-API, you can clone few macroeconomic indicators from here. 

```{python}

#pip install fredapi
from fredapi import Fred
import pandas as pd
fred = Fred(api_key='10fbe66f8f62ad7f44097cca867bf01f')
```

```{python}
series_id_1 = 'GDP' # for GDP US
series_id_2='GDPC1' # for Real Gross GDP
series_id_3='W207RC1Q156SBEA' # Adjusted Saving (% of GNI)
series_id_4='USAB6BLTT02STSAQ' # Current account balance (% of GDP)
series_id_5='A019RE1Q156NBEA' # Export of Goods and Services as percentage of GDP
series_id_6='MKTGNIUSA646NWDB' # GNI
start_date = '1973'
end_date = '2023'
```

```{python}

# Fetch the data
gdp_u = fred.get_series(series_id_1, start_date, end_date)
realgdp_u = fred.get_series(series_id_2, start_date, end_date)
adjsavings_u = fred.get_series(series_id_3, start_date, end_date)
currentaccbalance_u = fred.get_series(series_id_4, start_date, end_date)
exportsofgoods_u = fred.get_series(series_id_5, start_date, end_date)
gni_u= fred.get_series(series_id_6, start_date, end_date)

##### R API 

For R API, to retrieve more data about the US, R API, wbstats() API has been used. 

```{r}

#install.packages("wbstats")
library(wbstats)
library(dplyr)

```

```{r}
# Specify the indicators you want to fetch
indicator_b= ("NY.GDP.MKTP.CD") # GDP (current US$)
#indicator_c= ("GC.DOD.TOTL.CN") # General government gross debt (current LCU)
indicator_d= ("FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG") # For CPI
indicator_e= ("NE.IMP.GNFS.CD") # Import 
indicator_f= ("FP.CPI.TOTL") # For Inflation
indicator_g= ("NY.GNP.MKTP.CD") # For GNI
indicator_h= ("SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.ZS") # For Employement Population
indicator_i= ("SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS") # For Unemployment 
indicator_j= ("SH.DYN.MORT") # For Infant Mortality Rate
indicator_k= ("SP.DYN.LE00.IN") # For Life Expectancy 
indicator_l= ("SL.EMP.VULN.ZS") # For Engaged Workers
indicator_m= ("NE.CON.PRVT.CD") # For Private Final Consumption 

```

```{r}
