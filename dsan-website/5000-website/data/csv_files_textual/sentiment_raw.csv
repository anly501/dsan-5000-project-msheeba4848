"This plan is to kill the Petro Dollar run and manipulated by the Western Central Banks controlled by the cabal.

BRICS has replaced the fiat currency of the Petro Dollar with Gold. Gold is a tangible asset of value.

Supposedly, the Quantum Financial System (QFS) is on line and also backed by gold that will once and for all kill the cabal banking system setting mankind free from their slavery of control."
"It‚Äôs difficult to know what‚Äôs going to come out of the summit next week. First they announced the introduction of a gold-back currency intended to compete with the US$. Then they they said, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs just going to be a gold-linked trade settlement currency.‚Äù Of course that would also have a de-dollarization effect. Now they‚Äôre saying there won‚Äôt be discussion of a new currency of any sort, just that they‚Äôre wanting to conduct trade in local currencies. Have they been trolling the West with all this talk? Only time will tell. Also, will Saudi Arabia be admitted into BRICS? If so, will they begin selling oil for yuan to depart from the petrodollar? It‚Äôs been discussed and speculated about. But until it happens, it‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶speculation. Again, only time will tell."
"There is a lot to unpack as to what BRICS would bring to the table once it officially declares a trading currency and inducts the game-changer countries (üá¶üá™ üá∏üá¶ üá¶üá∑ üá©üáøand üá™üá¨) all big on either resources, oil, or fast growing economies. 

For all the ‚Äúnew world order‚Äù talks about BRICS, they are yet to come up with a core plan to do anything serious. Their only credibly accomplishment to date is their New Development Bank that has been funding development projects across the Global South.  

You see, BRICS are not like EU or NATO. They don‚Äôt have a common hegemonic design and are simply a bunch of eager investors wanting to utilize their newfound wealth and capitalize on low-base-high-growth developing economies and expand clout. 

The current member list has four big powers but unless more join and align seriously to the BRICS vision, things won‚Äôt be so easy for them."
"Nice that you ""feel"" that way. That's what BRICS is supped to do. Make you ""feel"" like they are another important power. In reality BRICS doesn't even have a mechanism to formally come to decisions."
"Seems like there well ahead of schedule, they already have 50 percent of the gdp with there new members and its 2023."
"Yeah, precisely. I fully explained this today to a family member. People will acknowledge it is important if it is explained to them but i don't know a single person from my past that would be aware of this information. No one on social media unless I go looking for it.

It is extraordinarily significant and could effect everything and it feels like only 0.1% of people, QAnon weirdos and traders actually know about it."
"I watched a lecture at school that predicted the global south will be equal in power and control to the global north by 2050. I forget who the dude was speaking. BRICS is the introduction to incubator meetings that are happening, and let's  encourage every country to have a seat at this table"
"I think, and I hope, that it happens sooner, rather than later. I live in the EU, and am fed up with the US affecting our daily lives, because the US has weaponised the dollar, and basically force every other country in the world to do their bidding. And also our politicians, who spend more time brown-nosing those in the Whitehouse, than improving the lives of the people living here."
It's supposed to happen in about a week hold on boys
BRICS countries can't agree on anything why would they agree how to manage a currency?
Any update on this?!
The BRICS currency will never be successfully launched‚Ä¶
"It will be discussed in August during the next Summit. But it's in a good phase. For the public, the project is BRICS Pay, take a look here: [https://youtu.be/LwX2IglEskE](https://youtu.be/LwX2IglEskE)"
I don't think that a currency is the solution. Exchange and/or sale of commodities and services I think would be the best way forward.
Fiat currency üí∏
What concrete difference does it make to be in BRICS?
Concrete is unlikely but so is it probably true for G7 countries as well.
De-dollarisation will occur by a thousand cuts.
"I think the conversation is above most peoples heads here. Even if you work at a banking firm or something you probably have limited tools to understand the global economic and banking system to this degree. 

Who can tell us any of this? Max Keiser? Gregory Mannarino? Zerohedge? Putin? 

... David Icke?

One would have to not only have an understanding of each countries economic system and a rough idea of the rough competency and intentions of the economic actors within it. But also then, after that understand the additional fraudulent systems in the banking. Not just the way things should work but how they actually do. 

Then you have to add in politics."
"People think that de-$ is a single blow waiting to happen. It‚Äôs not. Think of it more like a river slowly eroding it‚Äôs banks as it starts flowing. The process has already happened and it won‚Äôt be reflected in the trade data with our countries in the West. 

The tectonic shift would happen on the other side of the world, where the China and Indonesia, Thailand and India, UAE and Egypt, Malaysia and Russia, etc., will trade either in local currencies or in the new BRICS currency. 

Brazil has already started this on our side of the world with China and wants to do the same with Argentina. Given the geopolitical storm kicking off in Africa, it would see several of them jump on this bandwagon as the currency would be backed by real value of resources, and will be far more credible than ‚ÄúI say so‚Äù that currently runs the world. 

The New Development Bank of BRICS has already approved passing loans to countries in native BRICS currencies. So, Tanzania wanting a loan to import cargo trains would not mind taking ‚Çπ, and use it to ask the Indians to send the trains.  Same goes for Niger‚Äôs plan for their nuclear plant - Rosatom of Russia could easily give them loans in rubles via that bank and make it happen. 

Those two are easily worth $3-5billion combined. Imagine 50+ countries replicating this  at 100x the valuation in the next 5 years and multiple times."
Bro. TLDR.
"The USA is simply making noise, a last gasp and a big f-u to the emerging world to save what is already lost."
"Look at what America has done in the past to gain control over the things they wanted. By their own admissions they have taken out leaders of other countries and inserted more leaders with more ""favorable"" political views in line with America.

I do not for a second believe that America will just sit back while this happens. If anything, they are going to do more to hold onto that control as long as possible."

"I think us imports about 97% of lithium, and they're trying to get more and more EV cars on the market. If the spending power of the dollar reduces what will that mean for vital earth material imports.

"I'm not sure exactly what they want to do, but I believe it is not about changing to one currency, but setting a commodity (such as gold) as the int'l reserve currency instead of the US dollar. This is because the US dollar has been very unstable, has been weaponised by the US, and the US just puts more dollars into circulation. Gold won't have that problem."
"Do you believe countries like China and India will just drop their currency for some BRICS coin? Who would do the monetary policy? China propers by artificially keeping their currency low to boost exports. So if it's not that then what else? Just a new currency based on some basket of other currencies? Then anyone can ""participate"" by just swapping currencies."
"STEP 1: wait for at least 5 years before the currency comes up. 

STEP 2: apply to become a member of BRICS NDB bank. That‚Äôs what UAE, Argentina, Uruguay and Bangladesh did.

The currency is not going to replace the Renminbi, Rupee, Ruble, Rand and Real. It‚Äôs just going to supplement these for international trade. The valuation of the currency is going to be most likely against a basket of resources so that it‚Äôs more stable and not in the hands of a single country. 

Since BRICS has members that also happen to be rivals and competitors, this sits well with emerging economies since it won‚Äôt become a cartel like the G7 or EU or EU+US."
"currency trading is common.  You can just buy the BRICS currency and convert back to dollars after price volatility has settled down.  Same as Euro, Yen, Gold, or Bitcoin‚Ä¶"
I‚Äôm scared about this same thing imma go to Costco and fill my food pantry for 3 months
"Nothing is going to happen. Non-western countries who trade with each other might choose BRICS currency to trade with each other but the $ will still be one of the major currencies, if not the dominant one. 

There would be a limited impact on America‚Äôs ability to print endless $ meaning that the defense budget might deflate a bit (not too much, maybe half of the current $800 billion, which would still keep them at #1)."
"The mainstream media is controlled by western interests who see BRICS as a threat to the collective west. If they were to report on the positive developments of the BRICS organization, that would only improve the world view of BRICS, and create an ever-worsening view of the west. Visit zerohedge.com and rt.com and search ‚ÄúBRICS‚Äù and you‚Äôll get plenty of info."
"Every time I tried to post about it, I get the Reddit bot or even taken down. Glad to see someone posting about it!!!"
"It's likely due to there being very little chance, at this time, that BRICS will actually be adopted. Currently, it's just high hopes from struggling countries."
Yes very concerning.
"Its an agenda. They dont want you to know, thats why they're reporting on things like the arrest of trump or the banning of tik tok. Word to the wise, buy as much gold and silver as possible, and as far as crypto buy as xrp,xlm, and xdc as possible. U got 2 years max before things get out of hand for us."
"This has been their plan for years, whats the bets way to plan for the dollar losing itself?"
If anyone wants to stop using the US dollar send them to me I‚Äôll dispose of it properly
"Same here in my country. The lack of information and news coverage on it is definitely a clear sign that they dont want chaos to ensue. 

The silence is defeaning. I cant hold a proper conversation about it when none of my peers/colleagues/family members know nothing about it."
Because it would cause chaos. I'm very interested in this topic because it's scary
"Phrasing this way, seems like **agenda pushing**. China is pursuing a safer approach for international trading.

And it seems less as a _China' thing_, and more as a _Lula's thing_, as is pushing the same with Argentina."
"They won't succeed.  China is fucking broke.  Brazil is corrupt and going ass backwards under current leadership.  Africa is alao corrupt also and can't keep the lights on.  India is the only country that is doing well.  Russia is heading down the üöΩü™†ü™†.
China has no friends. They won't overtake the dollar."
"I keep seeing people talking about BRICS and from my understanding countries like Brazil, china, Russia, India trying to devalue American money. If we wanted to buy products worth $1 in there country we would have to pay $55 American dollars..I don‚Äôt know if this is 100% true though."
"You lost me with the first line ‚ÄúBRICS styled itself as a rival to the G7 and the US‚Äù never was that their mandate nor mentioned, to this day, by any BRICS leader (except maybe Putin)."
I hope that the transition will be as peaceful as possible although history tells us otherwise.

"France & Germany Confirm Joining China‚Äôs (AIIB) Bank ~ A Rival To US-led Rothschild World Bank.

March 17, 2015

Photo: China's President Xi Jinping (3rd R) meets with the guests at the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank launch ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing

Europeans defy US to join China-led bank:

The finance ministries of France and Germany have confirmed they‚Äôll join China‚Äôs new Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and Italy is expected to soon. Joining the rival to the US-led World Bank is seen as a setback for the Obama administration.

‚ÄúThe Ministry of Finance confirmed that France would join the AIIB bank,‚Äù French daily Le Figaro reported Tuesday.

Germany‚Äôs finance ministry said it was joining the bank, the BBC says, although Italy has yet to confirm the earlier report by the Financial Times (FT).

Why Is This?

BRICS

Move Over, IMF: BRICS Bank Aims to Rewrite the Rules of Development

BRICS ~ Brazil, Russia, India, China, & South Africa: Block Rothschild‚Äôs US and EU Computer Generated Ponzi Bailout Scheme Money Issuances.

The decision comes after Britain [?? This is Rothschild Country] last week became the first Western country to agree to become a founding member of the AIIB, FT reports.

The UK government said the decision was in the country‚Äôs national interest, but it got a negative reaction from the United States.

The new China-led bank is expected to challenge the Washington-based World Bank aka; [Rothschild World Bank aka IMF], so the US is increasing pressure on its allies not to join the institution.

The US‚Äô concern is that the new investment bank might not have high standards of governance and environmental and social safeguards.

British Operative Billionaire And Convicted Felon George Soros: Warns Sovereign American Citizens, Against Resisting The NWO International Banking System ‚Äì also Nicknamed ‚ÄúOpen Society‚Äù: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOjckJWqb0A

Is this real or is this another backdoor to NWO?

The new bank is expected to challenge the Western dominance of the US-led World Bank and IMF in global infrastructure projects, which experts believe will create healthy competition.

‚ÄúOur messaging to the Chinese consistently has been to welcome investment in infrastructure but to seek unmistakable evidence that this bank‚Ä¶ takes as its starting point the high watermark of what other multilateral development banks have done in terms of governance,‚Äù US Regional Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Russel said in Seoul, the Financial Times reports.

China To Cut Out Microsoft & Google.

The Big Dogs On Wall Street Are Starting To Get Very Nervous: Coming To America? China & Iran to Execute Bankers On Fraud Charges!

NWO Flushing the old system for a NWO China? ~ OR ~ NWO actually being flushed out by China & Russia for a sovereign existence?

The existing structures of world governance (UN Security Council, IMF, World Bank and the ADB) were essentially established in 1945, when the United States and Europe were predominant

The AIIB is just one of China‚Äôs recent efforts to remake the world‚Äôs multilateral institutions in its own image. In partnership with India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa, China also set up the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, last year, as well as a development bank led by the Shanghai Co-operation Organization and a currency reserve fund to help countries cushion against financial crises and shocks.

Washington has been lobbying its allies not to join the AIIB.

An Obama administration official quoted anonymously by the Financial Times accused the UK of ‚Äúa trend of constant accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power.‚Äù  Forbes

Meanwhile, Chinese officials say the AIIB‚Äôs operation and governance will be open, transparent, inclusive and responsible.

‚ÄúIt will draw experience from other multilateral development banks and avoid their detours so as to be more cost-effective and efficient,‚Äù Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei was cited as saying by Xinhua news agency.

He also added that the bank ‚Äúwill complement existing multilateral development banks and support the infrastructure and economic development in Asia.‚Äù

The three major financial institutions ‚Äì the IMF, the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank will not be able to cope with the tremendous amount of work that needs to be done, investment advisor at Motley Fool David Kuo told RT.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt politicize something like infrastructure.

People have a right to communication and a right to uninterrupted power ‚Äì these are all parts of the infrastructure projects that many countries are crying out for,‚Äù Kuo said.

He hopes that there will be a certain amount of competition with the new China-led investment bank.

Kuo suggests Germany, France and Italy have much to offer the Asian people, as they can bring expertise as well as money.

South Korea, Switzerland and Luxembourg were also considering joining the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Financial Times reported.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he would make a final decision on AIIB membership soon. South Korea and other countries are in discussions with China over possible participation.

China‚Äôs main regional rival Japan said earlier this month that Asian countries including Japan have until March 31 to decide on becoming AIIB founding members.

‚ÄúThey told us they are considering. Whether Japan will join, we do not know. It is Japan‚Äôs own decision,‚Äù Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said, according to the Xinhua news agency.

Nearly 30 countries have confirmed their participation in the AIIB, which is aimed at helping finance infrastructure projects across Asia and is expected to come into being this year.

The AIIB was formally launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2014, and is expected to become a tool of a broader Chinese push for growing international power and economic significance.

are the brics going to use xrp or Ripple
"Someone [send this](http://imgur.com/OgRcmrL) to Putin, before Brazil has the chance to SNAFU yet another space project."
No idea. The criteria for leaving and joining BRICS is still work in progress. None of those member countries have released any official papers on the full criteria.
"From the foreign policy podcasts, YT channels and few bit of articles I follow (mostly anti-capitalist, anti-imperial, but still China skeptical) I‚Äôve been hearing that the next winner of Argentina‚Äôs general election is likely to be right-leaning and opposed to BRICS membership."
Makes no difference if you are in or out of BRICS anyway
"You are a nutbag, asshole. Take care of your own country."
"Makes sense. People think that the $ would be dumped overnight just like that, without considering the sheer volume of trade and the overhaul of channels required to accommodate one more parallel SWIFT system. 

Without their BRICS currency, the only effect bilateral currency usage would have is on the top 5 trading countries for each one, and only non-Western countries. China is one partner but there are very few others who are big enough other than USA and EU. Both prefer dollars in trading."
"I know English is not exactly in BRICS wheelhouse but‚Ä¶ 

*Where* is the great discussion?"
"Global elites are all the same there using this event to take eyes of the ripple-sec lawsuite.

Can't you see the dates always coincide with major events."
There is no future for brics. It sounds nice but it won‚Äôt work.
"Good,it will allow the participant countries to benefit from each others in term of business, infrastructure, standard economy, employment opportunities.....and they will able to make one decision that will benefit them...by using single currency in which no any currency üí≤ in the world can't compete with....."
"I'm actually starting to agree also, seems BRICS talks as much as the west on issues."
"With Xi refusing to speak, its obvious that BRICS left the summit weaker than it came in."
Talk is cheap
Look into the R5 Project.
"BRICS has no relevance in practical world - it is being used as a negotiating platform with the west. For eg, saudis keep saying they will join BRICS if US doesn‚Äôt give them what they want."
Will this mean that if you have foreign currency you will make money from this ?
"Doesn‚Äôt matter what any of us think. What matters is what BRICS announces next week, if anything, and then what it actually is able to do. The US will not sit idly on its hands hoping against a BRICS currency. War is being waged, albeit this war, currently, is being fought on the financial battlefield. De-dollarization has started, and it‚Äôs picking up steam. BRICS, SCO, BRI, EAEU are coordinating their efforts and possibly combining to form the largest trade partnership in the world. If Saudi Arabia is granted BRICS membership, and it refuses to honor its petrodollar commitment, switching to a petroyuan, that will be a game changer indeed. Time will tell‚Ä¶it ALWAYS does!"
"My personal believe and I'm resolute on this opinion,

It'll be a universal currency amongst BRICS based on commodities not just gold, the value will be moved digitally in this new era we are moving into fast.

For sure BRICS is going to be the new big player in the world order, 2030 my ass."
"Not a chance imo. Crumbling currencies like the rubbles and rand would destroy the value if you operate on a fixed exchange rate. If you believe in ""brics"" you would be better off holding yuan or rupees and cut out the economic disasters like SA and RUS. Why would anyone want to park their assets in a basket that includes Russia and South Africa? If ""gold backing"" is the selling point you better off just buying gold. No need to trust tyrants like Putin or Xi."
"Doea anyone have the full pdf of ""china and the brics: setting up a different kitchen""? I really want to read it but the book isnt available in my country"
"That piece of s*** President of SA doesn't deserve to be chief guest for past - Indias Republic day.He allowed his race people to attack peaceful, successful people of Indian Origin of, no fault of them - sherr jealousy because they are hard working and successful."
"BRICS Nations to Kick Washington Out of South America

Pepe Escobar - RT - 23 May 2015

Image ¬© Reuters / Sergio Moraes
Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) and Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner arrive to the official photo session for the BRICS summit

It started in April with a rash of deals between Argentina and Russia during President Cristina Kirchner's visit to Moscow. 

And it continues with a $53 billion investment bang as Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visits Brazil during the first stop of yet another South American commercial offensive - complete with a sweet metaphor: 

Li riding on a made in China subway train that will ply a new metro line in Rio de Janeiro ahead of the 2016 Olympics. 

Where is the US in all this? 

Nowhere; little by little, yet inexorably, BRICS members China - and in a smaller measure, Russia - have been no less than restructuring commerce and infrastructure all across Latin America. 

Countless Chinese commercial missions have been plying these shores non-stop, much as the US did between World War I and II. 

In a key meeting in January with Latin American business leaders, President Xi Jinping promised to channel $250 billion for infrastructure projects in the next 10 years. 

Top infrastructure projects in Latin America are all being financed by Chinese capital - except the Mariel port in Cuba, whose financing comes from Brazil's BNDES and whose operation will be managed by Singaporean port operator PSA International Pte Ltd. Construction of the Nicaragua canal - bigger, wider and deeper than Panama's - started last year by a Hong Kong firm, to be finished by 2019. 

Argentina, for its part, clinched a $4.7 billion Chinese deal for the construction of two hydroelectric dams in Patagonia. 

Among the 35 deals clinched during Li's visit to Brazil, there was financing worth $7 billion for Brazil's oil giant Petrobras; 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to be sold to Tianjin Airlines for $1.3 billion; and a raft of agreements involving top iron ore producer Vale. 

Chinese investment might go some way into overhauling Brazil's appalling network of roads, railways and ports; airports are in slightly better condition due to upgrades prior to the World Cup last year. 

The star of the whole show is undoubtedly the proposed $30 billion, 3,500 kilometer-long, Atlantic-Pacific mega-railway, that is slated to run from the Brazilian port of Santos to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo via Amazonia. 

Logistically, this is a must for Brazil, offering it a Pacific gateway. 

Winners will inevitably be commodity producers - from iron ore to soya beans - exporting to Asia, mostly China. 

The Atlantic-Pacific railway may be an extremely complex project - involving everything from environmental and land rights issues to, crucially, the preference for Chinese firms every time Chinese banks deliberate on extending lines of credit. 

But this time, it's a go. 

The usual suspects are - what else - worried. 

Watch the geopolitics 

Official Brazilian policy, since the Lula years, has been to attract top Chinese investment. 

China is Brazil's top trading partner since 2009; it used to be the US. 

The trend started with food production, now it moves to investment in ports and railways, and the next stage will be technology transfer. 

The BRICS New Development Bank and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), of which Brazil is a key founding member, will definitely be part of the picture. 

The problem is this massive trade/commerce BRICS interplay is intersecting with a quite convoluted political process. 

The top three South American powers - Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, which also happen to be Mercosur members - have been facing repeated ""destabilization"" attempts by the usual suspects, who routinely denounce the foreign policy of Presidents Dilma Rousseff, Cristina Kirchner and Nicolas Maduro and yearn for the good ol' days of a dependent relationship with Washington. 

With different degrees of complexity - and internal strife - Brasilia, Buenos Aires and Caracas are all simultaneously facing plots against their institutional order. 

The usual suspects don't even try to dissimulate their near total diplomatic distance from the South American Top Three. 

Venezuela, under US sanctions, is considered a threat to US national security - something that does not even qualify as a bad joke. Kirchner has been under relentless diplomatic assault - not to mention US vulture funds targeting Argentina. 

And with Brasilia, relations are practically frozen since September 2013, when Rousseff suspended a visit to Washington in response to the NSA spying on Petrobras, and herself personally. 

And that leads us to a crucial geostrategic issue - so far unresolved. 

NSA spying may have leaked sensitive information on purpose to destabilize the Brazilian development agenda - which includes, in the case of Petrobras, the exploration of the largest oil deposits (the pre-salt) found so far in the young 21st century. 

What is unraveling is so crucial because Brazil is the second-biggest economy in the Americas (after the US); it is the biggest Latin American commercial and financial power; it hosts the former second-biggest development bank in the world, BNDES, now overtaken by the BRICS bank; and it also hosts the biggest corporation in Latin America, Petrobras, also one of the world's top energy giants. 

The hardcore pressure against Petrobras comes essentially from US shareholders - who act like the proverbial vultures, bent on bleeding the company and profit from it, allied with lobbyists who abhor Petrobras's status as the priority explorer of the pre-salt deposits. 

In a nutshell, Brazil is the last great sovereign frontier against unbounded hegemonic domination in the Americas. 

The Empire of Chaos had to be annoyed. 

Ride the continental wave 

The constantly evolving strategic partnership of the BRICS nations has been met by Washington circles not only with incredulity but fear. 

It's virtually impossible for Washington to do real damage to China - but much ""easier"", comparatively, in the case of Brazil or Russia. 

Even though Washington's wrath targets essentially China - which has dared to do deal after deal in the former ""America's backyard"". 

Once again, the Chinese strategy - as much as the Russian - is to keep calm and carry a ""win-win"" profile. 

Xi Jinping met with Maduro in January to do - what else - deals. 

He met with Cristina Kirchner in February to do the same - just as speculators were about to unleash another attack against the Argentine peso. 

Now there's Li's visit to South America. 

Needless to say, trade between South America and China continues to boom. 

Argentina exports food and soya beans; 
Brazil the same, plus oil, minerals and timber; 
Colombia sells oil and minerals; 
Peru and Chile, copper, and iron; 
Venezuela sells oil; 
Bolivia, minerals. 

China exports mostly high-value-added manufactured products. 

A key development to watch in the immediate future is the Transul project, which was first proposed at a BRICS conference last year in Rio. 

It boils down to a Brazil-China strategic alliance linking Brazilian industrial development to partial outsourcing of metals to China; as the Chinese increase their demand - they are building no less than 30 megalopolises up to 2030 - that will be met by Brazilian or Sino-Brazilian companies. 

Beijing has finally given its seal of approval. 

So the long-term Big Picture remains inexorable; BRICS and South American nations - which converge in the Unasur (The Union of South American Nations) - are betting on a multipolar world order, and a continental process of independence. 

It's easy to see how that is oceans away from a Monroe doctrine.

"What makes BRICS+ any different from the current regime when it comes to embracing some of the worst abuses of human rights? The US, Israel, and France are some of the worst countries in the world for human rights abuses, right up there with Afghanistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. The only difference is whose human rights are being abused."
"Just as the US invaded Vietnam, and Syria to give them freedom lol. I am from Brazil, I support the Brics and I don't think that Wester Countries have to interfere in our problems because We don't interfere in yours!"

If they start getting into terrorism then we're fucked"
"The inclusion criteria of BRICS is not based in the governance model of a potential member. 

The founders couldn‚Äôt care whether you‚Äôre a democracy, communist state, or a monarchy. They have clearly said that on several occasions. 

The group is completely geoeconomics-based and focused on trading, and boosting infrastructure projects. 
That‚Äôs because two of BRICS‚Äô largest members continue to grow on this very parameter. 

Also, three of the BRICS founders are democracies, and another one recently who joined is another.

Labeling them all with the same extreme label as Taliban-run Afghanistan or the crazy Kim-run North Korea reflects a lack of understanding of how other societies operate on your part."
I don‚Äôt believe in human rights. I just want a stable currency
I have a substantial sum of money tied up in Islamic bonds spread across the Asia Pacific and United States. I'd be curious to know how these investments are likely to be affected by BRICS and the devaluing of the USD.

"From A Concept to A Partnership: BRICS Members to Build Future Through Cooperation

By Li Hui - Global Research -  Aug 29, 2017 - People‚Äôs Daily

Link: http://globalresearch.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2cc48fb30f331d97157a65aa2&id=db955d6a89&e=8c306a1a59

The world is now casting its eyes on Xiamen, the coastal city in China‚Äôs Fujian Province, as it will host the ninth BRICS Summit themed ‚Äúdeepening the BRICS partnership and opening up a brighter future‚Äù in early September.

‚ÄúBRICS‚Äù, since its birth as a new concept, has evolved into a cooperative mechanism guided by the regular meeting of leaders from the five emerging markets‚ÄìBrazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.

The mechanism also involves a series of exchanges and dialogue activities, including regular ministerial meetings, business forums and think-tank forums.

Over the past decade, the BRICS bloc has transformed itself from a concept to an entity by strengthening dialogue, deepening cooperation and establishing the New Development Bank (NDB) and Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA).

The members, as a result, have contributed much to stimulating world economic growth, reforming and improving global economic governance and boosting democratization of international relations.

BRICS countries enjoy enormous potential for cooperation since they, being in similar development phase, share similar historical missions, development objectives, large population, huge market and highly complementary economies.

A closer relationship among the BRICS members would impact not only their own development, but the world economic growth and international order.

A community of shared interest, first of all, must be established among the BRICS countries.

The Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 has been recognized and supported by an increasing number of countries, among which Russia is an active one.

Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin signed a joint statement on docking the Silk Road Economic Belt initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) construction in May, 2015.

Moreover, China and other BRICS partners are also moving forward to align their development strategies and regional cooperation plans.

China‚Äôs investment and its external cooperation on production capacity can tighten the interest bonds of BRICS members and their peoples by giving a boost to their infrastructure construction and industry upgrade.

A community of actions should be set up among them as well. BRICS members, all influential nations in the region where they are located, share a strong sense of responsibility to promote the establishment of a global governance framework that can reflect the new world political and economic arena based on the principles of multipolarity.

The regular meetings between leaders can work as a platform on which the BRICS nations could exchange their views on key international and regional agendas, so that more joint actions could be launched to vindicate UN‚Äôs core status in international affairs, promote the democratization of international relations, and safeguard world peace and development.

By raising their voice and influence and sending a unified message, the five members have played a significant role in improving global governance and strengthening multilateralism.

A community of shared responsibility should also be built by the bloc.

As today‚Äôs world is still faced with rising trade protectionism, hegemonism and power politics, BRICS countries have a duty to safeguard the common interests of emerging markets and developing economies in terms of climatic change, reform of the International Monetary Fund, counter-terrorism, transnational crime, network security and other key agendas in global governance.

As big emerging markets and global stakeholders, BRICS nations have the responsibility for and the ability of providing rational solutions to address global challenges as well as more public goods for the international community on the premise of properly handling their own domestic affairs.

"Russia‚Äôs Ultimate Lethal Weapon

By Pepe Escobar | Mar 18, 2016 | ICH & RT

Let‚Äôs start with some classic Russian politics. 

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov is drawing up Russia's economic strategy for 2016, including the government budget. 

Siluanov ‚Äì essentially a liberal, in favor of foreign investment - will present his proposals to the Kremlin by the end of this month.

So far, nothing spectacular. 

But then, a few days ago, Kommersant leaked that Russia's Security Council asked presidential aide Sergei Glazyev to come up with a separate economic strategy, to be presented to the council this week. 

This is not exactly a novelty, as the Russian Security Council in the past has asked small strategy groups for their economic assessment.

The Security Council is led by Nikolai Patrushev, the former head of the Federal Security Service. 

He and Siluanov are not exactly on the same wavelength. 

And here‚Äôs where the plot thickens. Glazyev, a brilliant economist, is a Russian nationalist ‚Äì sanctioned personally by the US.

Glazyev is arguably going no holds barred. 

He is in favor of barring Russian companies from using foreign currency (which makes sense); 

taxing the conversion of rubles to foreign currencies (same); 

banning foreign loans to Russian firms (depending if they are not in US dollars or euro); 

and ‚Äì the smoking gun - requiring Russian companies that have Western loans to default.

Predictably, some sectors of US ‚ÄòThink Tankland‚Äô went bonkers, stating with utmost certainty that ‚Äúthe Russian energy sector would not be able to find much financing without connections to the West.‚Äù 

Nonsense. 

Russian firms would easily find financing from Chinese, Japanese or South Korean sources.

Whatever measure of attention Glazyev will get inside the Kremlin, the whole episode already means that Moscow harbors no illusions in the near future regarding the exceptionalists (one just has to look at the presidential candidates, from ‚ÄòEl Trumpissimo‚Äô to ‚ÄòThe Hillarator‚Äô); as Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov recently put it, ""[we] should expect toughening of the sanctions pressure.""

Once thing though is absolutely certain; Moscow won‚Äôt bend over backwards to ‚Äúpacify‚Äù Washington.

Neo-Tsarism, anyone?

One might be tempted to see Glazyev drawing up plans to return to some sort of Tsarist self-sufficiency while cutting off ties with the West. 

Assuming some version of that would be approved by the Kremlin, what‚Äôs certain is that it may turn into a huge blow the EU might not recover from.

Imagine Russia defaulting on all its foreign debt - over $700 billion ‚Äì on which Western sanctions have raised extra, punitive costs in terms of repayment.

The default would be payback for the twin Western manipulation of oil prices and the ruble. 

The manipulation involved unleashing on the oil market over five million barrels a day of excess reserve production that were held back by a few usual suspects, plus derivative manipulation at the NYMEX, crashing the price.

Then, the derivative manipulation of the ruble crashed the currency. 

Almost all imports to Russia were virtually blocked ‚Äì as oil and natural gas exports remained constant. In the long run though, this should create a significant balance of trade surplus for Russia; a very positive factor for long-term growth of Russia‚Äôs domestic industry.

Vladimir Yakunin, the former head of Russian Railways, now out due to a reshuffle, recently told AP in no uncertain terms how the aim of US sanctions was to cut off Russia economically from Europe.

Sanctions, coupled with speculation on oil and the ruble, pushed the Russian economy into recession in 2015. 

Yakunin, like most of the economic/business elite, expect Russia‚Äôs economic troubles to last at least until 2017.

Currently the only products that the West needs from Russia are oil and natural gas. 

A possible Russian default on its debt would have no effect on that demand in the short-term; and most probably in the long-term as well, unless it would contribute to a new financial crisis in the West, something that nearly happened in 1998.

We all remember August 1998, when a Russian default shook the entire Western financial system to the core. 

If a Russian default is now the object of serious consideration by the highest powers that be ‚Äì and that includes, of course, the FSB, SVR, GRU - then the specter of The Mother of All Financial Crisis in the West is back. 

And for the EU, that would be fatal.

It‚Äôs your fault we can‚Äôt loot

Enter Iran. 

The lifting of sanctions on Iran ‚Äì arguably by early 2016 ‚Äì ultimately has nothing to do with the nuclear dossier. 

It‚Äôs a ‚ÄòPipelineistan Great Game‚Äô, as in having everything to do with oil and natural gas.

The US ‚Äì and EU ‚Äì wet dream remains to replace Russia with Iran in terms of natural gas and oil imports to the EU. 

Every serious analyst knows this might take at least a decade, and over $200 billion in investment; not to mention Gazprom would fight it with the formidable ‚Äì commercial ‚Äì weapons in its arsenal.

At the same time Western financial powers in the New York-London axis did not anticipate that Moscow would not bow down and accept their demands that Putin lay off Ukraine - so that they could loot Ukraine‚Äôs mostly agricultural lands at will. 

They obviously didn‚Äôt learn from history; Putin also did not back off when he stopped them from looting Russia.

So the entire, sorrowful Kiev episode, as much as an infinite NATO expansion gambit, was also an attempt to stop Putin from preventing the Western looting of Ukraine.

What we had as a result was a tectonic geopolitical shift; the reconfiguration of the entire world balance of power as Russia and China deepened their strategic partnership - based on a mutual external threat coming mostly from the US, with the EU as accessories. 

Russian intelligence very well knows the alliance now makes Russia and China invulnerable, whereas separately they could easily fall victim to trademark Divide and Rule.

As for the counter-NATO angle, Russia has had plenty of time to remilitarize, focusing on defensive and offensive missiles; the key to the next major war, and not obsolete US aircraft carriers. 

Russian defensive missiles such as the state-of-the-art S-500 and the offensive Topol M - each with ten MIRVs - can easily neutralize whatever the Pentagon may have in store.

After Russia, Western financial ‚ÄòMasters of the Universe‚Äô went after China for allying with Russia. 

The usual financial suspects rigged the Chinese stock market in an attempt to crash the economy, using Wall Street proxies manipulating cash settlement mechanisms to first raise up the prices of the Chinese A shares, creating a giant boom, and then reversing the cash settlement rig to crash the market.

No wonder Beijing, very much aware of what was happening massively intervened; is actively studying cash settlement moves; and is carefully reviewing the records of major stock operators in China.

Round up those central bank suspects

The Kremlin‚Äôs got to do something about the Russian Central Bank.

The Russian Central Bank kept interest rates high, forcing Russian oil and natural gas producers to finance their operations from Western sources, and thereby plunging the Russian economy into a debt trap.

These loans to Russia were part of the New York-London financier axis control mechanism. 

Were Moscow to ‚Äúdisobey‚Äù the West, the West would call in their loans after crashing the ruble, making repayment almost impossible, as they did with Iran.

This is the mechanism through which the West ‚Äì and its institutions, the IMF, World Bank, BIS, the whole gang ‚Äì rule. 

Beijing is moving either to complement or replace this set-up with new and more democratic international institutions.

If the Russian Central Bank had operated under sounder principles, it would have lent money at interest rates below the West‚Äôs, and linked each loan to productive investment. 

A modus operandi totally different from the US - where much of the central bank credit goes to banks and financiers for their speculative scams.

Michael Hudson, among others, has already made the case that the entire Fed only serves the interest of its financial rulers and does not give a damn about American industrial infrastructure, which was progressively shifted to colonies and/or vassals, as well as to China.

So the ‚ÄòMasters of the Universe‚Äô thought hardcore pressure on both Russia and then China would work. 

It did not. 

There are reasons to be alarmed; the ‚ÄòMasters of the Universe‚Äô will keep raising the ante, higher and higher.

The scenario ahead spells out Russia further moving east while simultaneously moving to extricate itself from most of the West‚Äôs institutional architecture.  

The merger of the China-driven New Silk Roads, a.k.a. One Belt, One Road and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union, although slow and full of pitfalls, is irreversible. 

It‚Äôs in their mutual interest to invest and develop a pan-Eurasian emporium.

Iranian natural gas will go mostly to the Asian part of Eurasia, and not the EU. 

And the Chinese economy will at least triple over the next fifteen years as the US continues to de-industrialize.

Whatever Putin and Obama discuss at their possible meeting at the end of the month in New York, exceptionalist pressure over the bear won‚Äôt abate. 

So it pays for the bear to keep a lethal financial weapon in storage.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are allowing China and Russia to take advantage of shifting global economic interests and successfully counterbalance the [Rothschild] US hegemony.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and the BRICS have transformed into two influential political organizations with the prospect of becoming an alternative to the US-led global system, according to Stratfor.

The analysts stressed that while Beijing has steered the SCO ‚Äútoward an economic grouping,‚Äù Moscow has highlighted the forum‚Äôs ‚Äúpolitical role‚Äù and ‚Äúpushed for greater security cooperation.‚Äù

Furthermore, after including India and Pakistan into the SCO, the expanded organization may create an economic space that could ‚Äútheoretically‚Äù compete with the EU and the US, diminishing their economic leverage, namely sanctions and the dollar-dominated oil market.

On the other hand, the BRICS has been established to use an opportunity of shifting global economic and investment interests with the prospect to become a viable alternative to the [Rothschild] US-led global financial architecture. 

The analysts noted that regardless of certain economic obstacles faced by the emerging powers of BRICS over the recent decade, the group makes up to 20-30 percent of global GDP.

The analysts also pointed to the fact that the BRICS members have launched the New Development Bank with an initial capitalization of $100 billion.

‚ÄúBeijing sees the BRICS bank as yet another tool, along with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to pick away at the US-dominated financial system. 

With its financial system relatively isolated from the West because of sanctions, Moscow sees the development of alternative institutions as imperative at this time,‚Äù the Stratfor report elaborated.

"its forex, not etf. foreign exchange. buy currency. the idea is, the USD is a strong currency, if you use that currency to buy weak currency or cheap, and it eventually becomes a strong currency, you make money"
"OK, not a trader. But I would think that if this new currency starts a lot of things would start to happen.

We will call the new currency a ""brick"" for convenience.

A) Western business will have trade in bricks if they want to deal with other countries. Perhaps not immediately but soon enough, Euros, GBP, USD will start to get used less and less. This is significant because the West lives mainly on imports.

Like, Walmart will have to get their bananas via bricks. They will have to sell something to said countries to get bricks. 

B) Once those companies are doing a lot of their dealings in bricks. It will make things difficult for the tax offices of the Western countries. Since the other currencies are not on the gold standard there might not be exchangeable reserve mechanisms in place. So if you are making a profit of 10 bricks per week by selling say, wine to China, then the tax office will have to figure out how much you owe them. They can't just make up a number. Their systems are only built to deal with their own currencies and all currencies are exchangeable to USD. But USD might not have a correlation.

C) The need for bricks and such will probably open up a lot of markets to new companies from BRIC nations. In competition terms companies that use bricks will have a lot more flexibility and access. Theoretically you could have a Chinese company that comes into say... the German market. That can function way better because they know how to use the international currency properly.

D) In the Ukraine was the G7 nations used financial war against Russia. Which was strange since the banks are not beholden to the interests of politicians. Whoever made that choice will not be able to make that same sort of choice to threaten nations into behaving in line with their preferences.

E) In, not much time at all under this. Tourism and immigration will start to change. Much immigration is happening from Africa to the West at the moment. If the BRIC nations start to become financially dominant that will stop. People will start immigrating to BRICS instead of to the West. Meaning Western businesses appetite for cheap labour will not be satisfied and many industries will collapse."

"When Brics is generally accepted.....then other currency becomes insignificant..... imagine, dollar can't buy any commodity.....is otherwise useless. 1 Brics to $55....is out of it bro."
"With the way things are going, I think currencies such as the British pound, the Euro, the yen, etc, should move right away from their reliance in the dollar, and start building, and/or increasing their reserves in gold, silver, and other commodities. It will probably create a shit storm in the US, but I definitely think that it will be the best move for most of the World. I really think the US$ is screwed."

"Emergence of Great EURASIA Looming Against Background of Declining WEST

Vladimir NESTEROV | Saturday, July 11, 2015

The one superpower dominated world is becoming a thing of the past right in front of our eyes. 

Old international institutions are in decline, take the World Trade Organization (WTO), the European Union (EU) mired in crisis, or the degrading Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). 

So far, intense discussions of United Nations Organization reform have been nothing but shooting the breeze.

The United States has already seen its heyday. 

It is still going strong with its military, economic and political potential but there are other states breathing down its neck. 

China has surpassed the US in terms of GDP based on purchasing power parity (PPP). 

The cooperation among BRICS members is on the rise.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization is expanding with India and Pakistan on the way to membership. 

Greece, the homeland of democracy, has become the weakest link of the European Union. 

This fact serves to emphasize the degeneration of the Western democracies with their same-sex marriages and shaky foundations the national states are built on.

The United States starts to look more like a World War II battle ship with a large hole in the hull below the waterline. 

The damage is not visible, the ship continues to move with it formidable guns aimed at the enemy. 

But as time goes by the battle ship is losing speed and starts to go down.

The melting pot that was so much spoken of during the days of Bill Clinton‚Äôs tenure is not that effective anymore, the United States has failed to become a united nation and the time approaches when the Anglo-Saxons don‚Äôt have to shoulder the ‚ÄúWhite Man‚Äôs burden"" anymore with Latinos taking over as the dominant group.

When it happens, the United States will become a different country with different culture and, perhaps, different goals to pursue.

Today the United States is retreating to leave behind hotbeds of tension and unfinished wars. 

The armed conflict in Ukraine, the never ending war in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Iraq in ruins ‚Äì that‚Äôs what the retreat results in.

To slow down the process of degradation the United States is applying efforts to create the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) bringing together the golden bullion states as part of financial International.

But this the time when ‚Äúnew right¬ª and ‚Äúnew left¬ª in Europe are gaining strength to insert significant changes into the plans of Washington and the financial International mentioned above. 

They can either try to create a new system to unite nations, or go back to the idea of common security space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.

The United States is considering the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership as a project aimed at cutting Europe off from Russia and pushing the Russian Federation deeper into Asia. 

The US shies away from using the term Cold War in regard to the current psychological and informational stand-off but, actually, it is waging such a war on all fronts.

This affirmation is confirmed by increasing the strength and capacity of the NATO Response Force, returning US Army units to Europe, stationing forces in the countries which share borders with the Russian Federation, deploying missile defense elements in Europe, and launching debates to review the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF).

UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said in early June that the United Kingdom could site American new nuclear missiles on British soil amid heightened tensions with Russia.

There is no end in sight to the smouldering conflict in Ukraine. 

No matter all the attempts to restore peace (the Normandy Four, the mission of Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) there is a danger of sparking a big war with the United States stepping in one more time as a ‚ÄúEuropean savior"".

At the same time NATO forces would be deployed along the Russian border from the Baltics to the Black Sea. 

This scenario is still imminent. 

If the United States says ‚Äúyes"" to Ukraine joining NATO the situation will inevitably exacerbate further.

Europe‚Äôs freedom of action is limited by Atlantic doctrine, but the possibility of war with Russia is very scary, that‚Äôs why the United States doesn‚Äôt dare to pull the trigger so far. 

The recent trip of US State Secretary John Kerry to Sochi testifies to the fact that Washington is not ready for uncontrolled escalation of the conflict.

It‚Äôs clear for all that anti-Russian sanctions run contrary to the European interests. Europe would be happy to lift the sanctions but it has to save face. 

The best way to do it is to reduce tensions in the Donbass. 

But it makes imperative the government change in Kiev.

It all emphasizes the importance of cooperation within the framework of non-Western interstate associations: such as BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. 

Russia and China have a special role to play. 

The further progress of integration may lead to the emergence of Great Eurasia with large enclaves in Latin America and South Africa. 

It would create an alternative to Euro-Atlantic domination.

This May Russia and China agreed to integrate the Eurasian Economic Union with the ¬´Silk Road¬ª economic project. 

This and the success of Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRICS summits taking place at the same place at the same time in Ufa are the events that greatly contribute to the process.

"‚ÄúDe-Dollarization‚Äù: Iran, Russia Planning to Establish Joint Bank

By Global Research, October 13, 2014

Region: Middle East & North Africa, Russia and FSU

Theme: Global Economy

Fall of the Dollar on G-20 Finance Ministers Agenda

Iran and Russia plan to establish a joint bank as an effort to multiply bilateral trade and bypass sanctions on the Islamic Republic‚Äôs banking sector.

Head of the Iran-Russia Joint Chamber of Commerce Asadollah Asgaroladi said that Tehran and Moscow are studying the possibilities of opening a new chapter in trade relations that could break the domination of Western currencies over bilateral exchanges.

‚ÄúSince Russian banks fear the implications of working with Iran due to sanctions, we want to establish the joint Iran-Russia bank with the help of our central banks and private sectors,‚Äù Asgaroladi said.

‚ÄúSuch a bank would be able to exchange money between the two sides using rials and rubles and put aside dollars, euros and pounds,‚Äù he added.

Unilateral sanctions imposed on Iran‚Äôs banking sector by the US and the European Union over Tehran‚Äôs nuclear energy program and the recent Western bans against Russia over Ukraine have prompted the two countries‚Äô trade officials to boost economic cooperation.

Iran‚Äôs President Hassan Rouhani and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have held four meetings on different occasions after the Iranian president took office in 2013.

‚ÄúWe are responsible for our nation‚Äôs prosperity.

Before the sanctions, we had 150 billion euros of deposits in the banks of West and Europe.

When they sanctioned us, we transferred the money to other countries exactly where they don‚Äôt want to be,‚Äù Asgaroladi said.

Iran‚Äôs Minister of Economy Ali Tayyeb-Nia said the Islamic Republic has already traded with some of its partners through the exchange of national currencies and will welcome the plan to establish the joint bank with Russia.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad that our country is less dependent on several currencies and this process will continue in the future,‚Äù Tayyeb-Nia said.

In September, Iran and Russia agreed to use national currencies in bilateral trade.

"Launch Of BRICS Bank, Alternative To IMF

By Staff, July 13th, 2014

(Roberto Stuckert/AFP/Getty Images)

BRICS Development Bank, expected to be launched on 15 July 2014 in Fortaleza.

The BRICS Development Bank is expected to be officially launched on 15 July 2014, at the next BRICS summit in Brazil. 

The BRICS Development Bank is a proposed development bank run by the five BRICS states (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) as a potential alternative to the US controlled institutions of the Bretton Woods system‚ÄìWorld Bank and International Monetary Fund. 

The establishment of this development bank was first agreed by the leaders of the BRICS countries at the 5th BRICS summit held in Durban, South Africa, in July 2009. 

The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are expected to sign a treaty to launch the bank in the forthcoming BRICS summit in the northern Brazilian city of Fortaleza. 

The bank will, then, have to be ratified by the countries‚Äô legislatures and could begin lending as early as two years after this.

It is reported that the BRICS, by launching this new development bank, will be seeking to avoid some of the faults of the IMF, World Bank and regional development banks, i.e. too much rich country domination and too many conditions imposed upon the borrower country. 

It has also been mentioned that the BRICS Bank ought to be more transparent without being choked by heavy bureaucracy like the World Bank.

The stated aim of the BRICS Development Bank is to help to ensure economic stability for the Emerging Economies should the US dollar continue to fluctuate. 

The new bank will symbolize the growing influence of Emerging Powers, in particular the BRICS economies, in the global system long dominated by the US and its European allies through the institutional agencies of the Bretton Woods, IMF and World Bank. 

This new bank presents a new and clear step away from economic and financial dependence on the US-centered bloc by the BRICS economies.

It has been stated that the new bank aims to look into the finances of borrowers, but will have no intention to intervene in their economic and financial affairs. 

The basic idea is to provide emerging economies loans at a lower cost than what they currently would get in markets. 

The bank, whose headquarters is expected to be in Shanghai, will focus on infrastructure projects in Emerging Economies‚Äì borrowers will use the money for approved projects and cushion themselves from ups-and-downs in global markets.

The new bank will initially be quite small comparing to the size of the World Bank or the IMF, but it will be a strong reminder to the world of the need to reform global institutions to reflect the recent major shift in the global system towards the Emerging Powers.
